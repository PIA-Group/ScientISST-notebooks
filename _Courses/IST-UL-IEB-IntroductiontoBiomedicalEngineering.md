# Introduction of Biomedical Engineering (IBE)
```Mestrado Integrado em Engenharia Biomédica``` | ```Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa``` | ```2020-2021```

## Description & Objectives

The [IBE](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/IEB25179577/2020-2021/1-semestre) course aims to provide students with an early acquaintance of the field of Biomedical Engineering, in a Project-based Learning (PBL) paradigm. Students will:

- Have contact with typical cases taken from the practice, in order to stimulate the critical thinking and familiarize students with problems found in the practice of Biomedical Engineering, namely in the following areas: biomaterials, artificial organs, biotechnology, bioinformatics, computational biology , biomechanics, instrumentation, acquisition of physiological signals, diagnostic techniques;
  
- Analyze a concrete problem of their choice, proposed by Engineers and MDs that will be developed in small groups (e.g. how to develop a methodology and define a strategy to obtain a technical solution, outlining its practical implementation);
  
- Student groups will be encouraged to seek multiple information sources autonomously, in addition those provided by the tutors, with the purpose of solving practical problems, presenting their results in written and oral form for group discussions.

```Project-Based Learning (PBL)```, ```Active Learning```, ```m-learning```, ```Jupyter Notebooks```

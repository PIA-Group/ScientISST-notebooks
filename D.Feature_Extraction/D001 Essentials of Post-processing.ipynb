    "1. In many data acquisition systems, one of the pieces of information sent by the device is a timeline or at least a sample sequence number. This is particularly useful in the case of wireless devices, since inherent to their operation are aspects such as range, low battery, and others, which can lead to loss of samples. Knowing that in data recorded with BITalino the first column is a sequence number with 4-bit, implement a script to detect if samples were lost (or not) in a given recording.\n",

    "5. When working with thresholds, a problem is which value to choose. Modify the script developed in Section II.3. to use a multiple of the standard deviation from a portion of signal collected at the beginning of the data aquisition process with the muscle in a resting state (which is more dependent on the data itself). Present and discuss your observations."

    "One of the most common symptoms present in infeccious diseases is a fever, characterized by an increase in body temperature. Typically, this is monitored using conventional thermometers, which provide a simple measurement at a certain point in time. However, for specific situations, it could be advantageous to provide real-time temperature measurements, as to more closely monitor the progression of the disease. This is particularly important in pandemic situations, where the close monitoring of symptoms is essential."

In the one hand, these can be obtained using a large database of real ECG recordings, but these often contain plenty of artifacts plus altering parameters such as different levels or types of noise or the sampling frequency is not an easy task. In the other hand,  generating a synthetic ECG signal using a suitable signal model that can be precisely adjusted according to one's needs is a more appealing approach."

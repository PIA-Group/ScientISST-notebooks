    "Devices (and software as well) are often prepared to receive commands or execute instructions following a pre-defined format. In many cases, they also return results with a given structure (defined by a standard or by their developers) or transmit data packets as arrangements of bits and bytes. To simplify the programming, an abstraction layer to these lower level underpinnings is generally provided in the form of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These expose the main  actions and functionalities that can be performed with a given technology in a more developer-friendly way. In this lesson we will experiment with the BITalino API for Python, as an example of how one can interact with a biomedical device in various operations modes from within a custom program."

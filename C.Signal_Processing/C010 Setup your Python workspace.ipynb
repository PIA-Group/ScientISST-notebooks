    "*pySerial* is also a package written 100% in Python. It can be particularly interesting since it allows the computer to exchange data with external hardware such as voltmeters, oscilloscopes and, in this context, devices for biosignal acquisition. This is made through **serial communication**: process of sending data one bit at a time through a communication channel (opposite of parallel communication). The development of this type of communication allowed for example the creation of the USB (Universal Serial Bus)."

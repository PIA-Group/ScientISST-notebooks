    "    • Transport: Handles a data stream produced/received by an application-level component in what concerns the state of the connection, reliability assurance, congestion avoidance, channel sharing (i.e. multiplexing), and related operations; the best-known protocols in this layer are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which will be briefly describe in the next sub-sections.\n",

    "    • Internet: Manages the aspects related with the way data is sent to/received from the network; the most significant protocol in this layer is the Internet Protocol (IP), which is responsible for tasks such as defining the device addressing conventions within a network, fragmenting large chunks of data into (and regrouping from) smaller packets (aka datagrams) that can be better handled by the network, or for determining the path that a datagram should take based on receiving system’s address.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Link: Responsible for encapsulating the datagrams received from the upper layers in a way that is adjusted to the requirements and specifications of the physical components in the transmission medium used to interconnect different devices; a widely used link layer protocol is the Medium Access Control (MAC), found for example in WiFi, Bluetooth, ethernet and other interfaces, and which defines aspects such as the unique serial number of the interface, low level error detection and retransmission, among others."

Using the resources studied in Section II.4 and two computers connected to the same network, launch the server on one of the computers and determine the IP address of that computer (e.g. using  he ipconfig tool via the command line); put the HTML on the other computer and edit it to replace localhost by the IP address of the server when establishing the WebSockets connection. Open the HTML file on a web browser, observe and comment the results."
